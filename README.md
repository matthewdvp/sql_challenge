# sql_challenge

# Background
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, you've been tasked with researching the employee database from the 1980s and 1990s. There are six CSV files available, and your job is to design tables to hold the data, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and analyze the data.

# Instructions
Create a new repository called sql-challenge.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Download the CSV files from the Module 9 Challenge files link.
Use a tool like QuickDBD to sketch an entity relationship diagram.
Create a table schema for each of the CSV files.
Import the CSV files into their corresponding SQL tables.
Perform data analysis by running several SQL queries.


For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

# Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called sql-challenge. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for this Challenge. Use a folder name that corresponds to the Challenge, such as EmployeeSQL.

Note that you’ll add your files to this folder and push the changes to GitHub.
